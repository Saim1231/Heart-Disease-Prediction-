# Heart-Disease-Prediction-
This project study the use of machine learning model for heart disease prediction. The dataset includes various features such as demographic information, medical history, and laboratory test results. I used the dataset from UCI popular and largest different datasets repository. The patients data is collected from different countries patients. The models developed in this study include both traditional machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, logistic regression, and Random Forest and deep learning architectures, such as artificial neural networks. Additionally, the study also employs techniques such as cross-validation and exploratory data analysis for better understanding dataset and to process the data effectively. The results of the study show that machine learning models can effectively predict heart disease with high accuracy, and can be used as a valuable tool in clinical decision making.
